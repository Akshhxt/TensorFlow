        "\n",
        "There are two main benefits to using transfer learning:\n",
        "1. Can leverage an existing neural network architecture proven to work on problems similar to our own.\n",
        "2. Can leverage a working neural network architecture which has **already learned** patterns on similar data to our own. This often results in achieving great results with less custom data.\n",
        "\n",
        "What this means is, instead of hand-crafting our own neural network architectures or building them from scratch, we can utilise models which have worked for others.\n",
        "\n",
        "And instead of training our own models from scratch on our own datasets, we can take the patterns a model has learned from datasets such as [ImageNet](http://www.image-net.org/) (millions of images of different objects) and use them as the foundation of our own. Doing this often leads to getting great results with less data.\n",

        "- Using a smaller dataset to experiment faster (10% of training samples of 10 classes of food)\n",
        "- Build a transfer learning feature extraction model using TensorFlow Hub\n",
        "- Introduce the TensorBoard callback to track model training results\n",
